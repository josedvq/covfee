What distinguishes the HIT is that it is independent of any other HITs and it cannot be (or may not be convenient to) split into independent sub-units. Each HIT is normally identified by a single URL and is paid when completed. In Covfee we generalize this idea by using the term HIT to denote one or more tasks performed by one or more experiment subjects or annotators. For example, a HIT may be an online video conversation, or a game of chess to be completed by two people.
